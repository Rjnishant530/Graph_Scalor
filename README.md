# Graph_Scalor
Tool to help you with the Graph scale  


While conducting experiments we often come across a huge number of data points which we need to plot on the graph. I agree, its not easy to come up with the magic numbers of the X and Y axis to fit the entire data set.

I came across the same dilemma while doing my Transistor experiments, which had more than 20 to 25 data point in each experiment. Its really frustrating to repeat the same calculations for the same thing again and again.

So I made this simple C Program which takes those data value pair (x,y) as input and gives you the scale and every number on the scale
